Hi! My name is Kevin Koffroth and welcome to my site! This is a place for me to talk about and show off my engineering/software projects as a way to practice my technical and creative writing. It also provides me with an opportunity to document and talk about smaller project ideas that I would not otherwise pursue. In any case, I hope you enjoy your stay here and feel free to contact me by email or through social media.

# About Me

I am a Research Engineer at Georgia Tech Research Institute, where I get to work with some incredibly smart folks in the Test Engineering Division (TEN) of the Electronic Systems Laboratory (ELSYS). We work on solving Test and Evaluation (T&E) challenges for our sponsors in the DoD and beyond. At GTRI, I am involved in projects related to Electronic Warfare T&E where I get to work on Real-Time EW simulation and drivers for Data Acquisition devices. If you wish to contact me in relation to my work at GTRI, please email me at [kevin.koffroth@gtri.gatech.edu](mailto:kevin.koffroth@gtri.gatech.edu).

I have a degree in Computer Systems Engineering from the University of Georgia, where I took advanced electrical engineering and computing classes on topics like Digital Signal Processing, Computer Architecture, and Data Structures. In addition to my coursework, I was a Teaching Assistant for the Engineering Design Methodology class and through the summer in preparation for the new Computer Architecture class. I was also heavily involved in the [UGA Robotics Club](https://engineering.uga.edu/current/student-organizations/robotics-club), where I served as the club logistics officer and project lead for our [autonomous multirotor battery swap](https://github.com/uga-robotics/AutonomousHexacopter) project. 

When I get free time, I like to work on small software and hardware projects like those you'll see here, learn new songs on guitar, amd get out to enjoy nature.
