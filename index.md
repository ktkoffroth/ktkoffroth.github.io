Hi, My name is Kevin Koffroth, and welcome to my site! This is a place for me to talk about and show off some of my engineering/software projects as a way to practice my technical and creative writing. It also provides me with an opportunity to document and talk about little project ideas that I would not otherwise pursue. In any case, I hope you enjoy your stay here, and feel free to contact me by email or any of my social media.

# About Me

I'm a Senior Computer Systems Engineering student at the University of Georgia, where I take advanced electrical engineering and computing classes on topics like Digital Signal Processing, Computer Architecture, and Data Structures. In addition to my coursework, I am a Teaching Assistant, this past semester for the Engineering Design Methodology class and over the summer in preparation for the new Computer Architecture class. I am also heavily involved in the [UGA Robotics Club](https://engineering.uga.edu/current/student-organizations/robotics-club), where I serve as the club logistics officer and project lead for our [autonomous multirotor battery swap](https://github.com/uga-robotics/AutonomousHexacopter) project. 

When I get free time, I like to work on small software projects like those you'll see here, learn new songs on guitar, occasionally enjoy nature, and most commonly play [milsim video games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MilSim#Video_games) with my closest friends.
